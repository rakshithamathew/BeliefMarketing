                  MDLs involve many individual lawsuits consolidated in the same court for pretrial proceedings. Once
                  pretrial proceedings are complete, the individual cases are sent back to their original courts for
                  trial, unless they are settled before trial. Because MDLs are multiple trials, they can take longer to
                  resolve than class actions.

                  In their first U.S. Safety Report, Uber reported over 10,000 sexual assaults, kidnappings, and deaths
                  between 2017 and 2018. Thousands of survivors have come forward to seek justice from Uber for sexual
                  assault and filing a claim against Uber.

                  Before 2018, Uber required customers to pursue sexual assault claims through independent arbitration and
                  mediation rather than in court. This practice was criticized for keeping sexual assault cases out of the
                  public eye by requiring them to be handled in private arbitration proceedings.

                  Uber finally ended required mediation and arbitration in 2018 after immense pressure from sexual assault

                    For lawsuits against Uber, the length of the legal process can differ greatly, from several months to years, depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.
                  </p>
                  <p style={{ fontFamily: '"Avenir Book", sans-serif' }}>
                    In simpler cases where responsibility is clear, settlements can often be achieved relatively quickly, sometimes within a few months.
                  </p>
                  <p style={{ fontFamily: '"Avenir Book", sans-serif' }}>
                    However, in more complicated cases involving contested liability, severe injuries, or prolonged negotiations, the settlement timeline can be extended, requiring more time to reach a resolution.

                    Not every Uber sexual assault lawsuit will be settled—some may go to trial depending on various factors, including Uber and the lawyer's actions. Additionally, given the ongoing disputes with the Uber Multi-District Litigation, cases may take longer to resolve.
